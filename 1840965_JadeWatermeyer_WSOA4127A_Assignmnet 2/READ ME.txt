please note the buttons in these scenes are slightly visiable to display that they are there and that they can be clicked. 
nothing currently happens when some of the buttons are pressed, when the game is complete and a player presses on any of the 
ingredients they will appear in the players hand and be poured into the bowl. (the buttons will work when the game is fully 
functional.) this is the same for the sliders, currently we can manipulate the sliders manually- but they will be fully functional 
when the game is complete.
